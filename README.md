## ✨ Core Features

- 🌀 **Smooth Scrolling:** Integrated Lenis/Locomotive scroll for a buttery-smooth feel.
- 🧲 **Magnetic Interactions:** Magnetic buttons and menu items that follow the cursor.
- 🖼️ **Parallax Project Grids:** dynamic project displays with synchronized scroll-based movement.
- 📱 **Fully Responsive:** Meticulously crafted layouts that work from 4K monitors to mobile devices.
- 🎭 **Page Transitions:** Fluid morphing effects and entry animations using Framer Motion.
- 🎨 **SVG Path Animations:** Complex SVG masking and path manipulation for interactive UI elements.

## 🚀 Animation Libraries & Implementation

The "magic" of this site lies in its sophisticated animation stack. Below is how the core libraries are implemented:

### 🟢 GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
GSAP is the powerhouse behind the scroll-driven animations and complex timelines.
- **ScrollTrigger:** Used to trigger element reveals, parallax backgrounds, and text scrubbing as the user scrolls.
- **CustomEase:** Implemented to create the "organic" and "premium" bounce/friction feel in UI transitions.
- **Implementation:** Integrated within `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` hooks using `gsap.context()` for clean memory management and React compatibility.

### 🎬 Framer Motion
Used for high-level component lifecycle animations and micro-interactions.
- **AnimatePresence:** Orchestrates entry and exit animations for the navigation menu and page overlays.
- **Layout Animations:** Handles the seamless movement of elements when the state changes (e.g., filtering projects).

### 🌊 Lenis (Smooth Scroll)
Ensures that GSAP's `ScrollTrigger` stays perfectly in sync with the user's input.
- **RequestAnimationFrame:** The scroll loop is tied to the browser's refresh rate to prevent "jitter" often seen in standard CSS scrolling.
